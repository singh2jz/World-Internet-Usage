# World-Internet-Usage
A graph that shows the internet usage per 100 people in USA vs. The World Average over many years.

Data set provided by Makeover Monday. 

Given the data set, my goal was to create a visualization which would be able to compare a given conutry's data and the average of the rest of the world. The data is just the internet users per 100 people in each country throughout the years provided. I chose the United States, but wanted to code it in a way that I can change it later if I wanted. I moved the data of the comparable country out of the original data frame and into a new one. I then grouped the data of the world by year and took the mean of internet users, thus creating a world average for each year. The first three data points show a drastic difference in which The United States starts with everyone at around zero but quickly climbs to around three times the world average. You can then see how the last five years show the world on a linear uptrend while The United States seems to steady out. A few things that could have improved this visualization could have been more years of data and relation to population increase.
